# 1.2 Command Line and GitHub
 * Toogl timer 
 * Tick off task I've done :smile:

### Without using jargon, how would you describe<br>the command line to a lay person /(e.g yourmom)/?
Ok Mom, what is the command line, so you know about the computer and you know how to use the internet, right? There is a way you can control your computer with the text instead of clicking the icon. The command line is working with your command text, so you can open your ineternet browser open -a "Chrome". 
### List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.
 1. mkdir : make a **directory** and you can work with this directory for github. `Easy : create a folder`.
 2. pwd : you can find current directory where you are.
 3. rm -r : remove your directory 
 4. touch : create file 
 5. mv : rename file `e.g mv index.file index2.file`
 6. rm : remove file
 7. cd .. : back to previous directory
 8. exit : exit command line
 9. !! : command previous command 
 10. grep : find content in file `e.g grep head index.html`
